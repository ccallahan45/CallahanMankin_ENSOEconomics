# Persistent effect of El Nino on global economic growth

Replication code and data for "Persistent effect of El Nino on global economic growth," by Christopher Callahan and Justin Mankin, published in _Science_, May 2023.

The repository is organized into **Scripts/**, **Figures/**, and **Data/** folders.

- **Scripts/**: Code required to reproduce the findings of our work is included in this folder. Scripts are written primarily in Python, with R used for the empirical regression analysis. The scripts titled Fig1.ipynb, Fig2.ipynb, etc. contain the final code that produces the main text figures and most of the numbers cited in the text. 

- **Figures/**: Figures are saved here. This is also where figures will be saved if you run the scripts. Minor postprocessing in Adobe Illustrator was used occasionally (e.g., for Figure 2) but generally the figures output by the scripts will be the same as what appears in the paper.

- **Data/**: This folder includes intermediate and processed summary data that enable replication of most the figures and numbers cited in the text. Some of the files for the climate model projections and raw observational data are quite large, so they are not provided here. Should you desire any of this underlying data, feel free to contact me at _Christopher.W.Callahan.GR (at) dartmouth (dot) edu_ and I will be happy to organize a mass data transfer or point you in the direction of the publicly available data.
