# Persistent effect of El Nino on global economic growth

Replication code and data for "Persistent effect of El Nino on global economic growth," by Christopher Callahan and Justin Mankin, published in _Science_, May 2023.

The repository is organized into **Scripts/**, **Figures/**, and **Data/** folders.

- **Scripts/**: All code required to reproduce the findings of our work is included in this folder. 

- **Figures/**: The final figures from the main text are included in this folder.

- **Data/**: This folder includes intermediate and processed summary data that enable replication of most the figures and numbers cited in the text. Some of the files for the climate model projections are quite large, so they are not provided here. Should you desire any of this underlying data, feel free to contact me at _Christopher.W.Callahan.GR (at) dartmouth (dot) edu_ and I will be happy to organize a mass data transfer.
