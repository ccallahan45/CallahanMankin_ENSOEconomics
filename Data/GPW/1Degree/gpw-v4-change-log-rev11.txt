November 2017 Release, Revision 10 (4.10) Data Sets

New datasets:
	Basic Demographic Characteristics
		<provides global gridded estimates of population counts by age and sex for the year 2010, consistent with national censuses and population registers.>

In addition to the native 30 arc-second resolution data, the data have been aggregated to four lower resolutions to enable faster global processing and easier comparison to other data at these resolutions:
	2.5 minute
	15 minute
	30 minute
	1 degree

The data are available at all five resolutions in ASCII (text) format in addition to GeoTIFF format. The data sets available in ASCII format are:
	Population Count
	Population Density
	UN WPP-Adjusted Population Count
	UN WPP-Adjusted Population Density
	Data Quality Indicators
	Land and Water Area
	National Identifier Grid
	Basic Demographic Charateristics

The following data sets are available in netCDF format at all resolutions except 30 arc-second:
	Population Count
	Population Density
	UN WPP-Adjusted Population Count
	UN WPP-Adjusted Population Density
	Basic Demographic Charateristics

Global changes:
	The global water mask source was updated to include more recent glacier data and local water data sources for high latitude areas.
	Additional attributes have been added to the National Identifier Grid raster and polygon layers.

June 2016 Release, Version 4.0

A prerelease of Gridded Population of the World Version 4 (GPWv4) was made available in the 4th quarter of 2015 in a "Beta" web environment. There were a number of changes to the GPWv4 collection between the Beta release and version 4.0. The changes are listed below along with information on how to obtain the Beta version of GPWv4.

New data sets:
	National Identifier Grid
		<To provide a raster representation of nation-states in GPWv4 for use in aggregating population data.>

	Data Quality Indicators Mean Administrative Unit Area
		<provides a quantitative surface that indicates the size of the input unit(s) from which population count and density grids are derived.>


Country level changes:
	Egypt (EGY): The Beta version of Egypt's administrative boundaries and population estimates were found to be inaccurate. As a result a new source was acquired and incorporated into version 4.0
	Panama (PAN): corrected data integration errors
	Poland (POL): corrected data integration errors
